How to compile: from Linux prompt, "make".

How to run: from Linux prompt, ./Pex3 will launch the program.

Overview: This program utilizes a C++ class whose objects represent math sets.

Design: This program consists of a main.cc and a Set class.

Implementation: There are methods in the Set for construction, destruction, assignment, union, and
display. There are also helper functions in Set for sorting and extending arrays, as well as debug
display. The Set class has friend functions for I/O that are implemented in the main.cc.

Accomplishment: The big win in this assignment was a better understanding of how arrays work, esp.
how they can be passed into functions. Furthermore the introduction to friend functions and practice
with operator overloading has been extremely valuable.

Testing: Simple, no-error-checking I/O in the main allows for 2 Sets to be defined, values* checked
for duplication, union, insertion of a single value, and reporting of Set contents. 

Known Bugs: Non-integer input for order items causes recursive loop error.

Note: 

Marker's attention: Sometimes it works properly, and sometimes it misses a value, causing weird
results and failure to correctly union, report, and insert.

*value here refers to signed integers
