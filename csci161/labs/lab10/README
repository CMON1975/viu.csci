How to compile: from Linux prompt, "make".

How to run: from Linux prompt, ./Pex5 <filename.txt> will launch the program.

Overview: This program manages a users homework assignments. It
takes a .txt file as a command-line argument. If the file doesn't
exist, it will be created. The user can then (assuming data exists
in some cases) list the assignments in the file, show a detailed
list of an assignment's data, remove an assignment from the system,
add an assignment to the system, display the options, and export
back to the file and exit. The system uses a dictionary ADT to 
manage the data.

Design: The bulk of the program is carry-over from Lab 10, implement
Dictionary ADT. I chose a simple template, exception, and main
structure.

Implementation: Dictionary ADT with array for data management. 

Accomplishment: The program works as specified.

Testing: Tested up to 100 entries using random strings. 

Known Bugs: None.

Note: Very happy with this final attention.

Marker's attention: Thank you for all your extra help with this one.
