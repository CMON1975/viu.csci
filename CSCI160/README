A first course in computer science.
Topics include:
	- structure programming
	- top-down program design
	- procedures
	- recursion
	- intro to dynamic data structures

Topics, expanded:
	- basic command-line skills with Linux
	- basic syntax and semantics of C++
	- constants, variabls, literals for primitive data types
	- expressions and assignments
	- simple I/O including file I/O
	- functions and parameter passing
	- conditional and iterative control structures
	- recursion
	- documentation and program style
	- top-down program design and incremental development
	- enumerated types
	- arrays
	- strings and string processing
	- structs
	- pointers
	- dynamic memory allocation and release
	- intro to dynamic data structures

Course outcomes:
	- analyze and explain behavior of simple programs
	- identify and describe uses of primitive data types
	- write programs the use primitive data types
	- modify and expand short programs that use standard conditional/iterative controls
	- design, implement, test, and debug simple programs
	- choose appropriate conditional and iteration constructs for given tasks
	- describe recursion and give examples
	- identify base case and general case for recursively-defined problem
	- implement arrays, structs, and strings
	- implement pointers for dynamic memory allocation and release
	- apply consistent documentation/style standards for readability/maintainability
	- describe wild/dangling pointers and associated risks
	- describe dynamic data structures and their uses
