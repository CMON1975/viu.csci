To get back up to speed on proof by induction, especially as it applies to algorithms and abstract data types, you can focus on the following key areas:
#### 1. Understand Proof by Induction
Proof by induction is a two-step process used to prove that a statement holds for all natural numbers (or some well-defined sequence). Here's how it works.
- **Base Case:** Show that the statement holds for the first value, typically $n=1$ or $n=0$.
- **Induction Step:** Assume that the statement holds for some arbitrary $n=k$ (called the induction hypothesis), and then show that it must also hold for $n=k+1$.
#### 2. Induction in Algorithms and ADTs
Inductive reasoning is frequently applied to prove the correctness and efficiency of elgorithms, such as:
- **Recursion:** Induction is often used to prove the correctness of recursive algorithms, showing that the base case works and that the recursive step correctly reduces the problem.
- **Data Structures:** In abstract data types (ADTs) like trees, heaps, and linked lists, induction can prove properties such as balance, height, and traversal correctness.
#### 3. Key Topics to Review
- **Mathematical Induction Basics:** Go over basic proofs involving summations, inequalities, and sequences, Practice starting from simple cases like proving the sum of the first $n$ integers $S=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.
- **Structural Induction:** Review how induction is used on data structures like binary trees (for example, proving height or balance properties) or lists.
- **Algorithm Correctness:** Look at how induction proves that algorithms terminate and produce correct results, focusing on recursive algorithms.
#### 4. Common Examples in Algorithms
- **Fibonacci Sequence:** Proof by induction can be used to prove that the recursive Fibonacci function calculates the correct values.
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Inductive proofs are used to show the correctness of sorting algorithms like insertion sort and merge sort.
- **Tree Balance Properties:** Proof by induction is used to show that AVL trees maintain a logarithmic height.

Once you've reviewed these core ideas, practice constructing induction proofs for properties in algorithms and data structures.
