### An AVL tree that stores integer numbers in its nodes is shown below:
```
          7
        /   \
       5     20
      / \    / \
     3   7  15  25
           /  \
          10  17
```
Inserting numbers in which range (or ranges) would case a double rotation? Show the tree (or trees) after the rotation (You can use x to represent the newly inserted number).

#### Ranges Causing a Double Rotation:
- **First Range**: Inserting numbers **between 9 and 15** (i.e., 9 < x < 15).
    - **Explanation**: These numbers will be inserted into the **right subtree of node 10**, causing an imbalance at node 20 that requires a **Left-Right (LR) rotation**.
- **Second Range**: Inserting numbers between **16 and 19** (i.e., 16 < x < 20).
    - **Explanation**: These numbers will be inserted into the **left subtree of node 17**, leading to an imbalance at node 20 that necessitates a **Left-Right (LR) rotation**.

#### Trees After the Double Rotation**:
##### Example 1: Inserting x between 9 and 15 (e.g., x = 12)
1. **Initial Insertion**:
    - Insert **x = 12** into the tree.
    - Path: 7 → 20 →  15 → 10 →  **Insert x as the right child of 10**.

**Tree After Insertion**:
```
          7
        /   \
       5     20
      / \    / \
     3   7  15  25
           /  \
          10   17
           \
            x
```
2. **Imbalance Occurs**:
    - **Node 20** becomes unbalanced with a balance factor of +2 (left-heavy).
    - The imbalance is in the **Left-Right** case:
        - Left child (**15**) is left-heavy due to its right-heavy subtree (**10** with right child x).

3. **Performing Double Rotation (Left-Right Rotation at Node 20):**

**Step 1: Left Rotation on Node 10**
- Rotate left at node 10 to move x up.
```
          7
        /   \
       5     20
      / \    / \
     3   7  15  25
           /  \
          x    17
         / 
        10
```
**Step 2: Rotate right at node 20 to balance the tree**
```
          7
        /   \
       5      x
      / \    / \
     3   7  15  20
           /   /  \
          10  17  25
```
**Balanced Tree After Rotation:**
- The AVL tree is now balanced.
- x has become the new parent of nodes 15 and 20.
