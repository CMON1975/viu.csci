#### 1. Trees
a. Draw the red-black tree generated by inserting the following sequence of numbers one by one into an initially empty red-black tree:
```
{53, 36, 5, 50, 43, 13, 8, 88, 62, 78, 97, 33, 28, 4, 58}
```
Clearly identify the color of each node in the tree.
```
                     50(B)
                /            \
            36(B)             62(B)
            /  \           /        \
         8(R)   43(B)   53(B)       88(B)
        /   \              \       /     \
    5(B)    28(B)          58(R)  78(R)  97(R)
    /      /    \
  4(R)   13(R)  33(R)
```

b. Draw the (2,4)-tree that is equivalent to the above red-black tree.
```
                          [50]
              /                        \
          [8, 36]                       [62]
     /       |        \             /           \
[4, 5]  [13, 28, 33]  [43]     [53, 58]    [78, 88, 97]
```

c. What is an example of the minimum number of data item insertions that would cause an internal node split?
- Let's target the fullest leaf node with the fullest parent ([13, 28, 33] and [8, 36]).
- Inserting **1 number**, 34, causes [13, 28, 33] to overflow and promote to parent, resulting in [8, 34, 36] (now full).
- This also splits the leaf into [13] and [33, 34], meaning we'll need to insert **2 numbers** to cause the parent to split.
- Let's insert at the [4, 5] leaf so as to avoid duplication.
- Inserting 6 and 7 causes an overflow and split, promoting 6 to the parent and causing an overflow and split.
**Conclusion:** It would take at least 3 data items to cause an internal node split ({34, 6, 7}).

#### 2. Compute a table representing the KMP failure function for the following pattern string:
`tattarrattat`

I used the KMP algorithm from the class notes (http://csci.viu.ca/~liuh/260/Lectures/Lec09-StringMatching.html) and modified `failure` by adding this:

```cpp
// print the failure function
cout << "Failure function for pattern \"" << p << "\": ";
for (int k = 0; k < lenp; ++k) {
    cout << f[k] << " ";
}
cout << endl;
```

And then I assembled this `main`:

```cpp
int main() {
    string pattern;

    // Input the pattern
    cout << "Enter the pattern: ";
    getline(cin, pattern);

    // Prepare the failure array
    int lenp = pattern.length();
    int f[lenp];

    // Compute and display the failure function
    failure(f, pattern);

    return 0;
}
```

This produced:

```
Enter the pattern: tattarrattat
Failure function for pattern "tattarrattat": 0 0 1 1 2 0 0 0 1 1 2 3
```
