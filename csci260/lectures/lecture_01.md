# Abstract Data Types
Key questions for any ADT:
- What is it? (properties and typical operations)
- How to build it? (implementations with various concrete data structures and associated algorithms)
- How to use it? (typical applications)

**Concrete data strucutres**: arrays, structs, pointer-based lists.
**Abstract data types**: stacks, queues, trees.
## Topics
### ADTs
- Data objects as black boxes
    - Stack and Queue
    - Lists and Sets
- Data objects as black boxes with additional attributes
    - Priority Queue
    - Heap
- Data objects as opaque elements (reveal select internal information, i.e. keys)
    - Dictionary and Maps
    - Hashing and Hash Table
    - Tree
    - Skip List
    - Trie
- Heterogeneous elements together
    - Graph (nodes/edges)
- Simple but widely-used objects
    - Strings
### Algorithms
- recursion
- selection and sorting
- string matching
- data encoding and compression
- dynamic programming
- P and NP (time permitting)
### Complexity Analysis
- analysis in general
- Big-O Notation (and little-o, Big Omega, little Omega, and Theta)
- Recurrance Equation
- Proof by induction
- The Master Theorem
