# NaryTree Project
CHRISTOPHER NILSSEN README for LAB 04 CSCI 260 F2402

This project implements an N-ary tree data structure in C++. It includes two main files:
- `NaryTree.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the N-ary tree class and methods.
- `NaryTree.h`: The header file declaring the N-ary tree class and its methods.

## Requirements

- C++11 or later
- GNU Make (for compiling the project)

## How to Build

To compile the project, simply run:
```
make
```
This will compile the source files and produce an executable named `NaryTreeApp`.

## How to Run
After building the project, you can run the executable with:
```
./NaryTreeApp
```

## How to Clean

To remove the generated files, run:
```
make clean
```
